# Pig Game

[Pig Game](https://pig-game1000.netlify.app) is a computer-based game where two players can play together and one who gets 100 points or more than 100 wins the game. This game is dice related game. It's my 3rd frontend project to polish my javascript skills.

## 🤗 Contribute

**First- time contributors are welcome** — in fact, this is why I wanted to make it possible to contribute so you can get your first open source contribution.

Read the [contributing guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) to learn more.

## 🙏 Use Issues to Find Answers

If you need help or something isn't working, I made you can go to the [issues](https://github.com/Alexander01000/pig-game/issues) and find the issue and bring it to my attention — I hope in general people help each other out this way.

This avoids having to hunt down the issue you have in places like Discord that aren't indexed by search results and are lost forever.
